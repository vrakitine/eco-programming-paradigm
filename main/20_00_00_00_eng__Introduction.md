## Introduction
Let's do a simple experiment. Let's compare Google with two words:
- *eco-programming* -> nothing
- *eco-building* -> a lot of links to building materials and technologies

Why? Indeed, between construction and programming there is a lot in common.
As a result of construction, we get a certain material object that needs to be maintained, updated, adapted to changing external conditions or the needs of residents in case we are dealing with a residential building.
Verbs are well known and understood by programmers - to support, update, adapt, rebuild, test for stability, etc.

If you read what they thought up there, how to save everything and everything during construction and how to build it so that later it would be possible to save on support and ... then all this familiar to both owners of software products and owners of the house routine.
This is the paradox.
If during the construction of houses people began to think not only about how to quickly and inexpensively build, but how then to save on maintaining the houses in proper form, how to save on the reconstruction of the house, making it modular, for example. If you think globally, then Eco-building is about how to save the resources of our big house, planet Earth.
Is it time to start thinking globally and responsibly and think about ecology when creating software products?

For this, a new programming paradigm is proposed.

***eco-programming*** is a programming paradigm that assumes that any software product is useless and environmentally harmful to humanity in the long run, except for a software product that can be quickly and inexpensively reprogrammed (changed, updated) to work with new data in new conditions.

For example, all the benefits of eco-programming in web programming can be demonstrated in a simple questionnaire:
- [Web-site with concern for future changes](http://evaclickfsm.pythonanywhere.com)
- [Source code](https://github.com/vrakitine/eco-programming-webfsm01)

and compare how such questionnaires are done in the usual way, without thinking about the future of the software product:
- [Web-site without a Future](http://evaclickwithoutfsm.pythonanywhere.com)
- [Source code](https://github.com/vrakitine/eco-programming-web-without-fsm)

This document is for everyone to share their experience in eco-programming.

Good luck.
