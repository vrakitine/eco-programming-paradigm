## eco-web on the example of a questionnaire


All the benefits of eco-programming in web programming can be demonstrated in a simple questionnaire:
- [Web-site with concern for future changes](http://evaclickfsm.pythonanywhere.com)
- [Source code](https://github.com/vrakitine/eco-programming-webfsm01)

and compare how such questionnaires are done in the usual way, without thinking about the future of the software product:
- [Web-site without a Future](http://evaclickwithoutfsm.pythonanywhere.com)
- [Source code](https://github.com/vrakitine/eco-programming-web-without-fsm)


Detail and code description will coming soon
